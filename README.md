NewG8 is an open font family based on the original designs of Claude Garamond.

This project is derived from Michael Sharpe’s modifications to (URW)++’s Garamond No. 8, itself bearing close resemblance to Linotype/Adobe’s Stempel Garamond.

The project is forked from probonopd’s TTF conversions. Additional modifications so far include:

- Tidied character mappings, introducing OpenType features (old-style figures, small capitals, f-ligatures).
- Unified the package into four fonts.
- Tidied kerning pairs.
- Old-style figures are now the default since version 2.02. Lining figures remain available via OpenType features.

There is otherwise no change to the glyphs’ designs from 2017.
